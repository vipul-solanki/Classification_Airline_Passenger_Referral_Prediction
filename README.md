# Airline Passenger Referral Prediction

## Project Overview

This project involves building a classification model to predict airline passenger referrals. The model leverages various data science techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve robust performance.

## Key Steps in the Project

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed cabin distribution, passenger types, ratings, and more.

### Data Preparation

- **Feature Selection and Manipulation**: Identified and selected relevant features.
- **Data Scaling and Encoding**: Standardized data and converted categorical variables to numerical format.
- **Dimension Reduction**: Reduced the number of features to simplify the model.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Applied techniques to address imbalanced classes.
- **Train-Test Split**: Divided data into training and testing sets.

### Model Implementation

- **Libraries Used**: scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Models Implemented**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Model Evaluation**: Used recall, precision, F1 score, and ROC to assess model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **scikit-learn**
